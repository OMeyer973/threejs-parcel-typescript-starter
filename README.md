# Three JS + Parcel + Typescript starter

A sweet WebGL boilerplate

---

## Usage

### Dev

- Install the dev environment using `npm update` or `npm ci` (more resilient)
- Build + watch files during dev session with `npm start`

### Deploy

- Build on local machine with `npm run build`
- Build and publish to `"gh-pages"` live branch with `npm run deploy`

### Utilities

- "Something's wrong, I want to start a fresh build" `npm run predeploy` (delete last build & rebuild)

happy coding !
